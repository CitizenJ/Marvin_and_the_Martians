# ammuu/Marvin and the Martians

An old game I made in a week for a course back in 2014, using Jypeli library. It's an overhead run 'n gun video game (think Commando), where player does battle with infinitely spawning enemies of two varieties using an assault rifle and grenades. The game includes features such as full mouseaim, custom cursors, randomized enemy spawns, scoring and inbuilt help feature. It was selected as the 3rd best game of the course. Unfortunately the game does not seem to want to run in Windows 10, even in compability mode (it ran on Windows 7, though). The game is not in active development and is here merely for portfolio/documentary purposes.

First of all, I apologize for the messy repository. I couldn't open the project in modern Visual Studio, and thus resorted to dumping the entire project folder as a repository (some content originally used with creator's consent has been deleted from this repository). Here is a list of the files containing the most relevant source code:

- ammuu.cs: Contains the main game loop.
- BombHand.cs: Class for grenades, secondary weapon for the player.
- NativeMethods.cs: Class for loading a custom reticule-shaped cursor.
- Playa.cs: Class for the player character.
- Target.cs: Class for the enemies.

The source code includes comments, however they are in Finnish. Detailed descriptions of each class to be added sometime in the future.
