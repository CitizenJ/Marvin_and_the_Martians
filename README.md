# ammuu/Marvin and the Martians

An old game I made in a week for a course back in 2014. It was selected as the 3rd best game of the course. Unfortunately the game does not seem to want to run in Windows 10, even in compability mode (it ran on Windows 7, though). The game is not in active development and is here merely for portfolio purposes.

First of all, I apologize for the messy repository. I couldn't open the project in modern Visual Studio, and thus resorted to dumping the entire project folder as a repository.
